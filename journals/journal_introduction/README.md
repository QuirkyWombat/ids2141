# Journal Number 1

*From this point on, I've decided to write down everything I see and experience which might possibly have a bearing upon my nocturnal mission. This journal will be a complete record of my deeds which I can refer back to and a voucher to show [Lucas Von Hollen] when they come looking for me on [the Due Date].* 

Pulled from my LinkedIn -

Elias aspires to work in a cutting-edge technology and cybersecurity role that creates meaningful, community-focused impact."


Now that the formalities are out of the way, the real "me" begins. <br>
Hi, I am THE Elias Latimer, I love learning new things, reading literature (boring books by *boring* people like Kurt Vonnegut, Dostoyevsky, and Albert Camus), and generally being outside moving around whether that be in nature or playing intermural flag football with my friends. I am conflicted between choosing industry or academia because both seem equalling appealling and unfulfilling.

<br>Below is a photo with, what I believe to be, the best sandwhich ever from my December 2025 trip to Boston/Rhode Island with my partner.
