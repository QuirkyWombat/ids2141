# Journal Number 2

 _‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:_
 _Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’_
_Nothing beside remains. Round the decay_
_Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare_
_The lone and level sands stretch far away. - Percy Bysshe Shelley_

In this journal entry, I chose to not use appinventor by MIT/Google and instead chose to use, the also *well-loved*, Android Studio Code also developed by Google... I made a simple app that displays an image, some text, and a button that when clicked changes the text displayed on the button. I wanted to add audio on button click,as well as, having the text change back and forth between the two states, but got tired so instead I settled for the simple one click text change.
